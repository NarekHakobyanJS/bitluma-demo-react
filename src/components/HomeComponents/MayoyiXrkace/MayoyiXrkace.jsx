    <div>Welcome to Bitluma - the next generation cryptocurrency

    Bitluma is a universal token that can be used in different ways in the Bitluma ecosystem - transfers, payments, investments, voting, NFTs, DeFi, ReFi, staking, farming, and more. Our goal is to make the world a better place with the 7 basic laws of Bitluma - fairness, constructiveness, safety, efficiency, stability, speed, and ease of use.
    
    One of the biggest advantages of Bitluma is its use of DLT technology instead of a blockchain, which improves speed, cost, and scalability. Transactions on the network have a nominal fee of US$0.0001 and reach finality in three to five seconds. The network can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, making it a considerable improvement over most popular blockchains.
    
    Bitluma uses asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT) as its consensus algorithm, making it one of the most secure networks and resistant to DDoS and Sybil attacks. The consensus timestamps for transactions are calculated via an automated voting process, through which the nodes establish consensus democratically and collectively, making the network fair for all participants.
    
    The Bitluma Foundation is committed to protecting the value of the token by buying back Bitluma at a nominal price of 100,000 Armenian drams, ensuring that the price of Bitluma will never fall and the protection of effective tokenomics will only grow in value.
    
    Explore the Bitluma ecosystem and discover the endless possibilities it offers. Join us on our mission to make the world a better place with Bitluma.
